1. Campaign Reach & Engagement
The campaign reached an impressive 5.85 billion impressions, indicating strong visibility across Shopee’s platform.

This exposure translated to 2.4 million clicks, resulting in a Click-Through Rate (CTR) of 0.41%. While this CTR is modest, it's within range for high-impression awareness campaigns, particularly in the beauty category, where ad fatigue and visual saturation are common challenges.

📌 2. Cost Efficiency & Ad Spend Health
The total cost of the campaign amounted to RM114,997.65, yielding:

A Cost Per Click (CPC) of RM0.05 — indicating highly efficient spend to drive user interaction.

A Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM) of RM0.20, which is exceptionally low. This suggests the campaign was well-optimized for cost-efficient reach, ideal for awareness-focused objectives.

The Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) is 10.42, meaning that for every RM1 spent, the campaign generated RM10.42 in revenue — an excellent performance benchmark, signaling both high effectiveness and profitability.

📌 3. Revenue Contribution & Conversion Health
The campaign drove a total Revenue of RM1,197,834.46, with RM1.59M in Order Value and 43,214 Orders.

The Aggregated Order Value stands at RM27.72, meaning that each customer on average spends around RM28 per transaction — aligning with typical consumer behavior for mid-tier beauty brands.

The Conversion Rate (Orders/Clicks) is 1.80%, which is slightly below e-commerce benchmarks (usually between 2%-3%) but still acceptable for traffic-oriented campaigns. This might suggest a need to investigate landing page experience or SKU attractiveness.

📌 4. Funnel Health: Add-To-Cart & Purchase Behavior
The Add to Cart (ATC) metric stands at 7,741, resulting in an ATC Rate of 0.32%. This is relatively low compared to the volume of clicks, indicating potential friction between click intent and purchase consideration.

Despite strong clicks and impressions, the cart-to-order ratio appears steep, which may indicate:

Pricing mismatch

Uncompetitive SKU bundles

Issues with promotional messaging, discounting strategy, or delivery fees at checkout

📌 5. Net Profit & Campaign Profitability
With a total revenue of RM1.19M and a cost of RM114.9K, the net profit is RM1,082,837 — a strong indicator that the media investment was both strategic and efficient.

The profit-to-cost ratio exceeds 9:1, showcasing clear room to scale the campaign or reinvest budget into higher-performing SKUs or categories

1. Revenue Leadership & Underperformers
Top Performer: Emina generated RM 954,700 (highest revenue), but with low ROAS (5), suggesting volume-driven but inefficient ad spend.

Secondary Performers: Crystalline (RM 316,941) and Kahf (RM 254,607) balanced revenue with strong ROAS (16 and 13).

Lagging SKUs: OMG and Wardah had the lowest revenue (RM 167K and RM 146K), but Wardah’s profitability was highest (see below).

2. Profitability Paradox
Wardah: Despite low revenue, it delivered the highest net profit (RM 126,105), indicating exceptional margins or cost efficiency.

Crystalline: Moderate profit (RM 26,704) but high costs (RM 25K total)—opportunity to streamline operations.

3. Marketing Efficiency (ROAS)
Best ROAS: Crystalline (16) and Kahf (13)—reallocate budget here for higher returns.

Lowest ROAS: Emina (5) despite high revenue. Investigate ad targeting or creative fatigue.

4. Cost & Order Analysis
High Costs: Crystalline’s costs (RM 25K) were disproportionate to profit.

Order Value: Crystalline and Kahf drove the highest per-order value (RM 40 and RM 35), ideal for upselling.

Order Volume: Intraperfect and Wardah led in orders (8.3K and 6.6K), but Wardah’s low revenue suggests low average order value.
