# E-Commerce-Ads-Performance-Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard showcasing brand awareness campaign performance on Shopee Search Ads.


# Shopee Ads Dashboard 📊

This dashboard presents a comprehensive performance analysis of Shopee Beauty Brand Ads, designed to provide key stakeholders with clear visibility into campaign efficiency and profitability. The analysis showcases over 5.85 billion impressions and 2.4 million clicks, leading to RM1.19 million in total revenue at a highly efficient RM0.05 CPC and RM0.20 CPM. With a 10.42 Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and RM1.08 million in net profit, the campaign delivered strong financial returns.

Beyond topline success, the dashboard provides actionable insights into user engagement and behavior, such as a 1.80% conversion rate, a modest 0.32% ATC rate, and an average order value of RM27.72. These metrics help uncover optimization opportunities in cart conversions and customer journey flow. This project demonstrates a full-funnel performance marketing analysis — integrating paid media metrics with e-commerce KPIs — and highlights areas for future improvements across creative, product bundling, and targeting strategies.

Built using Power BI, this project reflects my ability to interpret digital performance data, create business-relevant dashboards, and translate raw numbers into meaningful marketing insight

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this dashboard is to evaluate and optimize the performance of Shopee Beauty Brand paid campaigns by integrating platform advertising metrics with e-commerce sales data. As a media buyer, my focus is to ensure budget efficiency, maximize Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), and uncover opportunities to improve audience targeting, ad creatives, and product positioning.

By visualizing key KPIs such as impressions, clicks, CPC, CPM, conversion rate, and net profit, this dashboard enables data-driven decision-making that supports both short-term performance gains and long-term brand growth.

📌 Stakeholder Use Cases
Marketing Director: Quickly assess campaign ROI, identify top-performing SKUs, and decide where to allocate additional budget for maximum impact.

Brand Manager: Understand which products and creatives resonate most with target audiences to refine messaging and positioning.

E-commerce Manager: Monitor SKU-level sales performance to optimize inventory planning and product visibility on the platform.

Finance & Strategy Teams: Align advertising investment with profitability goals by tracking net profit and ROAS in real time.

This dashboard serves as a practical example of how performance marketing insights can be transformed into actionable strategies that drive profitability in competitive e-commerce environments.

1. Campaign Reach & Engagement
The campaign reached an impressive 5.85 billion impressions, indicating strong visibility across Shopee’s platform.

This exposure translated to 2.4 million clicks, resulting in a Click-Through Rate (CTR) of 0.41%. While this CTR is modest, it's within range for high-impression awareness campaigns, particularly in the beauty category, where ad fatigue and visual saturation are common challenges.

📌 2. Cost Efficiency & Ad Spend Health
The total cost of the campaign amounted to RM114,997.65, yielding:

A Cost Per Click (CPC) of RM0.05 — indicating highly efficient spend to drive user interaction.

A Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM) of RM0.20, which is exceptionally low. This suggests the campaign was well-optimized for cost-efficient reach, ideal for awareness-focused objectives.

The Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) is 10.42, meaning that for every RM1 spent, the campaign generated RM10.42 in revenue — an excellent performance benchmark, signaling both high effectiveness and profitability.

📌 3. Revenue Contribution & Conversion Health
The campaign drove a total Revenue of RM1,197,834.46, with RM1.59M in Order Value and 43,214 Orders.

The Aggregated Order Value stands at RM27.72, meaning that each customer on average spends around RM28 per transaction — aligning with typical consumer behavior for mid-tier beauty brands.

The Conversion Rate (Orders/Clicks) is 1.80%, which is slightly below e-commerce benchmarks (usually between 2%-3%) but still acceptable for traffic-oriented campaigns. This might suggest a need to investigate landing page experience or SKU attractiveness.

📌 4. Funnel Health: Add-To-Cart & Purchase Behavior
The Add to Cart (ATC) metric stands at 7,741, resulting in an ATC Rate of 0.32%. This is relatively low compared to the volume of clicks, indicating potential friction between click intent and purchase consideration.

Despite strong clicks and impressions, the cart-to-order ratio appears steep, which may indicate:

Pricing mismatch

Uncompetitive SKU bundles

Issues with promotional messaging, discounting strategy, or delivery fees at checkout

📌 5. Net Profit & Campaign Profitability
With a total revenue of RM1.19M and a cost of RM114.9K, the net profit is RM1,082,837 — a strong indicator that the media investment was both strategic and efficient.

The profit-to-cost ratio exceeds 9:1, showcasing clear room to scale the campaign or reinvest budget into higher-performing SKUs or categories

1. Revenue Leadership & Underperformers
Top Performer: Emina generated RM 954,700 (highest revenue), but with low ROAS (5), suggesting volume-driven but inefficient ad spend.

Secondary Performers: Crystalline (RM 316,941) and Kahf (RM 254,607) balanced revenue with strong ROAS (16 and 13).

Lagging SKUs: OMG and Wardah had the lowest revenue (RM 167K and RM 146K), but Wardah’s profitability was highest (see below).

2. Profitability Paradox
Wardah: Despite low revenue, it delivered the highest net profit (RM 126,105), indicating exceptional margins or cost efficiency.

Crystalline: Moderate profit (RM 26,704) but high costs (RM 25K total)—opportunity to streamline operations.

3. Marketing Efficiency (ROAS)
Best ROAS: Crystalline (16) and Kahf (13)—reallocate budget here for higher returns.

Lowest ROAS: Emina (5) despite high revenue. Investigate ad targeting or creative fatigue.

4. Cost & Order Analysis
High Costs: Crystalline’s costs (RM 25K) were disproportionate to profit.

Order Value: Crystalline and Kahf drove the highest per-order value (RM 40 and RM 35), ideal for upselling.

Order Volume: Intraperfect and Wardah led in orders (8.3K and 6.6K), but Wardah’s low revenue suggests low average order value.
